- After making changes and verifying them commit using standard syntax and commit messages
- When working from the implementation plan implement a step, test and validate it, commit the changes, and move on to the next step
- Default to using yarn instead of npm
- Whenever possible, enshrine new functionality like backend business logic or frontend components via unit tests
- The implementation plan is located in the project root in the file called implementation-plan.md
- Review CLAUDE.md after compacting and respect project memory
- Assume frontend dev server is running on port 3000
- Assume backend dev server is running on port 3001

- After making changes and verifying them commit using standard syntax and commit messages
- When working from the implementation plan implement a step, test and validate it, commit the changes, and move on to the next step
- Default to using yarn instead of npm
- Whenever possible, enshrine new functionality like backend business logic or frontend components via unit tests
